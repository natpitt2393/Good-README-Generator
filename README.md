  The user must first install node. After that the user will also install the inquirer module. Without the inquirer module, the program will not be able to prompt the user with questions.
  ## Usage 
  You will need to run npm init -y and npm i inquirer
  ## Contributing 
  They can add more conditional statements to check for invalid responses. Nathaniel Epstein.
